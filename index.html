    <p align="center"><i>Paris</i> is a beautiful city that is filled with things to do! From fashion to architecture, Paris has it all. These are <i>three</i> places you must visit in Paris!</p>

    <h2>The Eiffel Tower</h2>
    <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en" target="_blank"> <img src="eif.jpg" alt="The Eiffel Tower" title="Visit The Eiffel" width="200px"> </a>
    <p>The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground â€“ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.</p>

    <h2>Arc de Triomphe</h2>
    <a href="http://www.paris-arc-de-triomphe.fr/en/" target="_blank"> <img src="arc.jpg" alt="Arc de Triomphe" title="Visit The Arc" width="200px"> </a>
    <p>A key place of major national events. Wanted by Napoleon in 1806, the Arc de Triomphe was inaugurated in 1836 by French king, Louis-Philippe, who dedicated it to the armies of the Revolution and the Empire. The Unknown Soldier was buried at the base of the arch in 1921. The flame of remembrance is rekindled every day at 18:30.</p>

    <h4><i>Newsfeed</i></h4>
    <p>The Eiffel Tower closed down on Monday after a man began trying to scale the Paris monument. A person could be seen dangling just below the third and highest level of the structure. A rescuer dressed in red was just above him. Police said the climber was a male. It wasn't immediately clear how the trespasser managed to get past the stringent security system. A Paris police spokeswoman said a team of firefighters including a climbing specialist was on the scene and in touch with the intruder, whose motivations remain unclear.</p>
